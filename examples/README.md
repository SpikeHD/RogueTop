# Examples

This directory contains mod examples and documentation in order for you to better wrap your head around how it works. I promise it's super easy!

*\*For now, mods are only supported in offline mode. This will probably change in the future!*

## How Modding Works

Mods exist in their own folders. So, if you make or download a mod called "MyMod", the mods folder should look like so:
```sh
mods/
  # Your mod goes into "replacers" because it replaces files in the game
  replacers/
    MyMod/
      # ... all of your files
```

When a new folder is added to a users mods directory, it is automatically added to the mod list.

## How to Activate Mods

Any changes a mod makes will apply automatically the next time the user loads the game. This doesn't even require a full restart, just press `Ctrl+R`!

## How do I Create a Texture/Audio/Font Mod?

Your mod must match the file structure of [PokeRogue](https://github.com/pagefaultgames/pokerogue/blob/main/). Here's an example:

* You want to replace the PokeRogue logo with your modified one.
* Anything that would be in the "public" folder of the PokeRogue repository should be in the ROOT of your "MyMod" folder.
  * In this example, you are replacing `public/images/logo.png`, so your mod folder should contain `images/logo.png` like so:
    ```sh
    # PokeRogue Structure:
    public/
      images/
        logo.png

    # Your Mod Structure:
    MyMod/
      images/
        logo.png
    ```

If you are familiar with how The Binding of Isaac mods work, this is basically the same. The result should be instantly noticeable, and the example provided in `mods/LogoReplacer` will result in the following:

## Another Example - Audio Mod

Now, let's say you want to replace Pikachu's cry. In the PokeRogue repository, the file is located at `public/audio/cry/25.m4a` (because Pikachu is Pok√©mon #25). So, your mod folder should look like this:

```sh
# PokeRogue Structure:
public/
  audio/
    cry/
      25.m4a

# Your Mod Structure:
MyMod/
  audio/
    cry/
      25.m4a
```

That's it! Your mod should now properly apply! You can verify this by starting a new game and selecting the Pokemon in the starter selection menu (if you have them unlocked).

# Good Luck!

If this document didn't make it click, that's fine, just take a look at the `mods/` folder here and see how it works. Both examples written here are present in that folder. It's really simple once you get the hang of it!
